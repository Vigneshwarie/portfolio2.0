                         This is Vigneswari Sambandam, aka Viggy, an accomplished IT professional with 10+ years of experience developing and architecting IT applications across industries with a proven track record of delivering value to Healthcare, Telecom, and Service Industries businesses. I wanted to upskill myself and embrace the changes and happenings in recent years in IT. Hence, I recently completed a masterâ€™s in information technology, further enhancing software development and project management skills. I also graduated from UC Berkeley and completed Coding Bootcamp for additional skills. Apart from work and studies, I love watching movies, listening to music, and sometimes reading books. I empathize with people and hate all kinds of discrimination against individuals.
